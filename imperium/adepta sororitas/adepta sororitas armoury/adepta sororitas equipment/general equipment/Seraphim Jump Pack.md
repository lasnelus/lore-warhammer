A **laud-hailer**, or **loud hailer**, is a voice amplification device used in the Imperium. Laud-hailers are often utilised in war as a type of psychological warfare "weapon".

## Overview
---
Laud-hailers are often used by priests of the Adeptus Ministorum to increase the volume of their booming sermons of the Imperial Cult and God-Emperor. Their battle-gear sometimes incorporates laud-hailers so that their foes can hear the catechisms and curses being screamed at them, even on the noisiest battlefields.

Like other Ministorum forces, Sisters of Battle use laud-hailers to emit proclamations of their righteous fury to strikes fear into the hearts of the enemy.

## Known Patterns
---

The **Faith-hailer model** of the **Holy Word Pattern** is popular among missionaries, confessors, and preachers across the Moebian Domain.
