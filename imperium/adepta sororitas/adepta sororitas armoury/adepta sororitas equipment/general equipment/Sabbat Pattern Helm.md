The **Sabbat Pattern Sororitas Helm** is the main kind of helmet used by the [[Sisters of Battle Power Armour|Power Armoured Sisters of Battle]].

## Overview

The **Sabbat Pattern Helm** is used by the majority of the Sisters of Battle since the middle of the 38th millennium.Other patterns include the Ophelia pattern helm.

The helmet protects the wearer's head against physical blows, seals the armour to withstand adverse environments, and is crafted from psy-nullifing materials to provide some defence against witches and the powers of the Warp.

The helmet is equipped with various subsystems, including an integral rebreather that permit operation in total vacuum or contaminated atmospheres for limited periods, full spectrum filtering and psycho-ocular buffering that immunize the Sister against adverse battlefield conditions, a Photo-Visor, Preysight, Rargeter and comm-link. As such the helm reveals infiltrated units and provides advanced tactical readouts. Some are also equipped with Psyocculums that allow them to immediately detect psykers and Daemons.

Depending on the sector, access to the helm may be restricted outside of areas where the environment make its use mandatory. The Order of the Sacred Rose in the Kaurava system awarded it only to the most courageous Adepta Sororitas, while the Orders of the Calixis Sector did not usually issue a helmet to a Sister until she had proven herself.

Some variants sport a fleur-de-lys mounted upon the front, an honour reserved for sisters having performed with exceptional courage and honour. Such insignas are common amongst the elite Celestian squads and the veteran Sisters Superior leading their sistren into battle.
