A **Rosarius** is an amulet that incorporates a powerful conversion field generator to defend the wearer from attack. A rare and highly prized piece of technology, it is also an icon of the Imperial Creed, and entrusted only to the highest officials of the Ecclesiarchy.

## Overview

The Rosarius takes the form of an amulet, often displaying the Aquila or a square, stylized cross of adamantium or other durable metal, with a jewel or Ecclesiarchy symbol in the center. It is worn around the neck or waist on a sash, a cord, or a string of prayer beads.

It contains a tiny conversion field generator, emitting a protective energy barrier around the wearer. The field's effect converts the energy of an impact into light; thus, a blinding flash is produced when the field stops a shot. The field is capable of rendering even plasma gun shots harmless.

The rosarius is referred to as the _"soul's armour."

## Examples of Use

- The most notable bearers of Rosarii are Space Marine Chaplains, who receive them from the Ecclesiarchy as a symbol of the link they share.
- The Wolf Priests of the Space Wolves Chapter, who combine the roles of Chaplain and Apothecary, are equipped with Wolf Amulets, which confer many of the same benefits.
- Confessors and Missionaries also wear rosarii.
- Inquisitors sometimes carry them as well, although it is probably out of practical concerns rather than allegiance to the Ecclesiarchy.
- Are worn by Canonesses of the Adepta Sororitas.
- Also, a large number of Witch Hunters  carry a Rosarius due to the affiliation between the Adepta Sororitas and the Adeptus Ministorum.
- Goge Vandire used a rosarius to trick the Brides of the Emperor into believing he had the Emperor's grace by having a soldier shoot him only to seemingly be divinely protected.
- Cardinal Xaphan acquired a rosarius prior to an attempt on his life by a Vindicare sniper, whose unerring shot was handily blocked by the device's field.
