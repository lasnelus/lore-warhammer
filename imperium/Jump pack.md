A **Jump Pack** is a back mounted device containing turbines or jets powerful enough to lift even a user in [[Power Armour]].
## Overview

Jump packs are based on ancient [[STC]] technology. Intake vents on the top of the pack intake air to feed the jets, while the turbine blades expel it to create lift. Even with the aid of the power armour's energy coils the jump pack has its own fuel supply, such is the power required to send a fully armed and armoured [Space Marine](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Space_Marine "Space Marine") into the sky. A Jump Pack is usually good for around a dozen or so "jumps" before it must be refuelled or discarded.

A jump pack greatly enhances a warrior's mobility by allowing him to travel quickly across the battlefield, making great bounding leaps over obstructions and launching him into the melee of close combat. Its roaring engines can also slow the wearer's descent when leaping from low-flying aircraft, allowing him to [Deep Strike](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Deep_Strike "Deep Strike") with relative safety directly into the fray

Some models of jump pack feature inbuilt [grenade launchers](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Grenade_launcher "Grenade launcher") that can clear out the space that the user will land in.
