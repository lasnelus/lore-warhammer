A **Jump Pack** is a back mounted device containing turbines or jets powerful enough to lift even a user in [[Power Armour]].
## Overview

Jump packs are based on ancient [[STC]] technology. Intake vents on the top of the pack intake air to feed the jets, while the turbine blades expel it to create lift. Even with the aid of the power armour's energy coils the jump pack has its own fuel supply, such is the power required to send a fully armed and armoured Space Marine into the sky. A Jump Pack is usually good for around a dozen or so "jumps" before it must be refuelled or discarded.

A jump pack greatly enhances a warrior's mobility by allowing him to travel quickly across the battlefield, making great bounding leaps over obstructions and launching him into the melee of close combat. Its roaring engines can also slow the wearer's descent when leaping from low-flying aircraft, allowing him to Deep Strike with relative safety directly into the fray

Some models of jump pack feature inbuilt grenade launchers that can clear out the space that the user will land in.

## Vehicular Jump Packs

- Contemptor-Incaendius Dreadnought - In the days of the Horus Heresy, the **Contemptor-Incaendius Class Dreadnought** was developed by the Blood Angels Legion with a powerful rocket booster pack, allowing it make a controlled descent from orbit, or cover the distance to its foe in a series of long leaps. Once its fuel is exhausted, explosive bolts disengage the spent pack from the chassis.
- Titan Jump Packs - Imperial Titans may be fitted with colossal jump packs. Such boosters of incredible power allow the mighty god-machines to leap over obstructing buildings or even other Titans in battle. Such jump packs may even be salvaged from incapacitated Titans, though they are irrevocably destroyed if the Titan were to suffer catastrophic reactor damage or crushed when the Titan suffers severe leg damage.
