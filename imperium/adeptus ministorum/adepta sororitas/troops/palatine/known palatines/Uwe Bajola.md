When she was young, she was originally inducted into one of the Orders Famulous, serving under Canoness Reich. In her service as a Sister Famulous, she worked alongside multiple Ordo Hereticus Inquisitors and arbitrated between Planetary Governors.

Later in life, she became a Battle Sister of the Order of the Wounded Heart. She was on Ras Shakeh, serving under Canoness de Chatelaine, in late M41 when the planet was attacked by Chaos forces aligned to the Chaos God Nurgle. Due to her diplomatic experience with the Orders Famulous, de Chatelaine appointed her as the liaison between the Order and the Space Wolves pack sent to aid them.
