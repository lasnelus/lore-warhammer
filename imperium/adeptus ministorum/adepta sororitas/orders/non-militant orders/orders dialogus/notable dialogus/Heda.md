Heda is a Sister Dialogus of the Adepta Sororitas.

### History
---
In M42, she was part of an Imperial fleet, that was sent to end a Chaos rebellion on the vital Mining World Siscia. Heda was among the Sororitas that were under the command of Canoness Preceptor Oris, who had command of the Retribution Class Battleship Fiery Heart. The Battleship was sent by the fleet to Siscia as its vanguard. Oris' forces would then aid in invading the world, when the rest of the fleet arrived there. However as the Canoness' forces prepared themselves, Oris was approached by the Ordo Hereticus Inquisitor Ander, who sought her assistance. Before the rebellion had begun, Ander had sent one of his Acolytes to Siscia, in search of a powerful object and to discover who led the Cult. This was before it became such a dire threat and Ander had lost contact with his Acolyte since the uprising began. He asked Oris to secretly send a effiecnt force of Sororitas to find his Acolyte, before the fleet began its invasion. He also requested that a Sister Dialogus be among the Sororitas sent, as well. Oris agreed and sent a force of 8 Sororitas to Siscia, who were led by Canoness Veridyan. Heda was chosen as the Sister Dialogus, who would accompany them to the besieged world.
