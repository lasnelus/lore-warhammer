**Sarida** was a [[Canoness]] of the [[Order of the Ebon Chalice]], who led an invasion to reclaim [[St Rezmond's Hope]] after it had been conquered by [[Zagstruck|Boss Zagstruck]].

Launched in early **M42**, the Canoness's invasion initially went well, as they were able to reclaim religious artefacts and destroy Zagstruck's images carved into the world's holy mountain. However, this was due to Zagstruck merely using the invasion as a means to train his Stormboy Yoofs. When Sarida and her Battle Sisters attacked Zagstruck's Bossfort, though, he finally joined the fight with his elite forces. He soon struck the Battle Sisters and killed Sarida by dropping onto her with his bionik feet. Within an hour of the Canoness' death, the Order of the Ebon Chalice were forced to escape the Ork held world. After hearing word of their failure, the Abbess of the Adepta Sororitas successfully petitioned the Officio Assassinorum to send an assassin to try and kill Boss Zagstruck.
