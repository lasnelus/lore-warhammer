**Alicia Dominica**, **Patron Saint of the Sisterhood**, **Bearer of the Grail of Ages**, **Founder of the [[Order of the Ebon Chalice]]**, is renowned throughout the Imperium as both the founder and patron of the Adepta Sororitas and as the Sister who ended the [[Reign of Blood]] when she beheaded the [[Goge Vandire|High Lord Goge Vandire]].

### The Age of Apostasy
---
During the [[Age of Apostasy]], **Alicia Dominica** was the leader of [[Goge Vandire]]'s bodyguards, the [[Brides of the Emperor]]. At the height of the [[Reign of Blood]] a small contingent of Adeptus Custodes made their way into the heart of **Vandire**'s domain, only to be confronted by Dominica and her fellow Brides. The [[Longinus|Custodes Longinus]] called for truce and parley; laying down his arms, he made impassioned pleas for the Brides to revoke their oaths to **Vandire**, arguing that they were serving evil rather than the Emperor. The Brides, however, were not swayed by his oratory; so leaving his men as hostages, the [[Longinus|Centurion]] led Dominica and five of her companions ([[Saint Katherine]], [[Saint Silvana]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Mina]] and [[Saint Arabella]]) through the tunnels below the Imperial Palace towards the most sacred place in the galaxy - The Golden Throne, the resting place of the Emperor himself.

What occurred before the Emperor remains unrecorded but when **Dominica** and her companions emerged from the bowels of the palace they renounced the name Brides, returning to their original title, Daughters of the Emperor. Dominica emerged from her encounter with the Emperor with her hair turned white and a mysterious artifact known as the Grail of Ages. Today, the [[Order of the Ebon Chalice]] acts as the guardian of its secrets. The Daughters marched to **Vandire**'s throne room, finding him in the midst of a bloodthirsty tirade; pausing only to condemn **Vandire** for his crimes, Dominica cut the head from the traitor High Lord's shoulders.

The words spoken to **Vandire** before his execution are engraved on Dominica's sarcophagus:

```
"You have committed the ultimate heresy. Not only have you turned your back on the Emperor and stepped from his light, you have profaned his name and almost destroyed everything he has striven to build. You have perverted and twisted the path he has laid for mankind to tread. As your own decrees have stated, there can be no mercy for such a criminal. I renounce your lordship, you walk in the darkness and cannot be allowed to live. Your sentence has been long overdue and now it is time for you to die."
```

### The Reformation and Beyond
---
In the aftermath of **Vandire**'s tyranny, [[Sebastian Thor]] reformed the shattered [[Adeptus Ministorum]]. Following **Thor**'s instructions, **Dominica** formally established the Sisterhood - the Orders Militant of the Adepta Sororitas, with the Sisters divided between the Convents on [[Terra]] and [[Ophelia VII]] and with Dominica herself as both founder and overall patron.

Over time the Adepta Sororitas numbers grew to over 10,000 Sisters and **Sebastian Thor**'s successor, [[Alexis XXII|Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII]], divided the Convents' forces into two Orders each - the Order of the Ebon Chalice and the Order of the Argent Shroud on Terra and the Order of the Valorous Heart and Order of the Fiery Heart on Ophelia VII. Of these four groups, the Order of the Ebon Chalice was established as Dominica's own personal Order.

Dominica led her sisters for several centuries, overseeing the early years of the Adepta Sororitas and leading her Sisters on many crusades, before finally falling in battle at the [[Scourging of Frideswide's World]]. It was recorded that she survived literally hundreds of wounds before one lasgun blast finally found a weakness in her armor and pierced her heart in 650.M36. At some point before her death, Dominica was declared a **Living Saint**.

The symbol of Dominica's Order is the skull-filled and flaming Ebon Chalice that represents the terrible knowledge imparted to Dominica when she was brought before the Golden Throne, though few know the significance of the symbol.
