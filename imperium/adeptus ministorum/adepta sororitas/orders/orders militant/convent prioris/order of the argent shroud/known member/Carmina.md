**Carmina** was a [[Canoness]] of the [[Order of the Argent Shroud]] with a reputation as a master tactician.

She commanded **Argent Shroud** forces in the **Third War for Armageddon**, where they fought in the Fire Wastes alongside the Space Marines of the **Flesh Tearers Chapter**. Over the course of the fighting, she became horrified by the Flesh Tearers' brutality, particularly when they slaughtered many militia and Imperial citizens at **Gaius Point** after losing control and going berserk fighting against the orks.

Carmina has requested a full **Inquisitorial** investigation of the Chapter. For his part, **Chapter Master Gabriel Seth** has directed his Chapter's forces elsewhere in the Wastes, away from other Imperial forces.
