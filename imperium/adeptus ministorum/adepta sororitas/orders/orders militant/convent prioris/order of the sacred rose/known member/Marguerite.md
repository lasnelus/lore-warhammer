**Marguerite** is an **Adepta Sororitas** [[Novitiate]] of the [[Order of the Sacred Rose]], who serves the [[Aveline Aboyé|Celestian Sacresant Superior Aveline Aboyé]].

### History
---
During the [[13th Black Crusade]], **Marguerite** was among [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]]'s strike force that the [[Rex Bellorum]] transported to the besieged Imperial world [[Struthian Tertius]]. There they fought the [[Cult of the Eightfold Prophet]] which was attacking the [[Shrine of Saint Lycestra of the Nine Wounds]]. As the [[Order of the Sacred Rose]] fought the **Cult**, led its spear-point into the Heretic forces and **Marguerite** was unable to keep up with the **Celestian Sacresant**. As she fell behind, **Marguerite** implored [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]] to wait, as the **Novitiate** wanted to fight at the **Celestian**'s side. This request was denied by an annoyed [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]], who felt the quavering **Marguerite** had not earned the right to do so, if she could not keep up with the Celestian. Once the Cult was defeated, **Marguerite** apologized to [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]] for falling behind and the disapproving Celestian told her to do better next time. Soon afterwards, the [[Rex Bellorum]] received a message for [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]] from the [[Talitha|Canoness Talitha]]. After greeting the Celestian, [[Talitha]] ordered [[Aveline Aboyé|Aboyé]]'s strike force to immediately join the **Adepta Sororitas** warhost gathering at [[Orison VIII]].
