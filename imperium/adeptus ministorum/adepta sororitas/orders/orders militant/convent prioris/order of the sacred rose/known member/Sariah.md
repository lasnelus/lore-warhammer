**Sariah** is a [[Canoness]] of the Adepta Sororitas'[[Order of the Sacred Rose]]. In 835.M41 she led a force of Battle Sisters to the [[Piety|Shrine World of Piety]], which had been consumed by a Warp storm for two centuries. They found the planet almost entirely corrupted save for the Reliquary of Hope. Sariah led a mission into the labyrinth of the Reliquary, though only she herself and two Celestians returned bearing three pages of the [[Lexicon of Falsehoods]] and the left thighbone of [[Saint Dolan]]. They left the planet just before the Grey Knights arrived to deliver **Exterminatus** to the planet.
