Anjelis Gartayga is a [[Canoness|Preceptoress]] of the [[Order of the Sacred Rose]], who was among the Imperial forces that are defending [[Harlecrypt Tertius]], during the [[Prosperan Rift War]].

### History
---
She was stationed within [[Mausoleum City Seven]], but **Gartayga** was later kidnapped, along with 8 others, by the **Thousand Sons Warpcoven** of [[Tolbek Azhtar Sum]]. According to information gathered by [[Idon Throom|Interrogator-Lieutenant Idon Throom]], besides all being important figures in the City's defense, there is little else that currently connects them together. However given the Thousand Sons's penchant for obscure schemes, he believes the Warpcoven undoubtedly had a reason to choose these individuals.
