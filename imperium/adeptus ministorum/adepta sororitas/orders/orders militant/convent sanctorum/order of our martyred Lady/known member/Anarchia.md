**Anarchia** was a Battle Sister of the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]], who was taken captive by the Tau Empire in M42. However, she taught her interrogators what it truly means to be one of the faithful. After encountering the newly risen Imperial [[Saint Nixia Ameldus]] during the T'au invasion of [[Mantra Primau]], she was convinced to surrender to the Xenos in order to kill their leader. After being taken prisoner by the T'au and retalling Nixia's story, Anarchia freed herself and killed one of the Ethereals, [[Aun'Do]], in a suicidal attack.
