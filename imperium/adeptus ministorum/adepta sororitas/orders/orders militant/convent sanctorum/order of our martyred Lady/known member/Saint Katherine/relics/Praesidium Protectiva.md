A **Praesidium Protectiva** is a shield constructed from layers of [[armaplas]] and [[ceramite]], and said to contain a shard of the [[One true armour|Emperor's own armour]]. As such it is highly effective against physical attacks, offering protection equal to that of Power Armour. They are only found among the Adepta Sororitas, and even then are only issued to those Sisters who excel (and prefer to engage in) hand-to-hand combat. However, some have found their way into the hands of Witch Hunters.

It is however quite large and heavy, to the point that it is considered inadvisable to carry one without wearing [[power armour]].
