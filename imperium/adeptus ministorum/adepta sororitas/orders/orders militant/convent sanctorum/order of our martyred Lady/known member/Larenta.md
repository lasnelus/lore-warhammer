**Larenta** was a [[Canoness]] of the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]], who served within [[Battle Group Erastus|Indomitus Crusade Fleet Secundus' Battle Group Erastus]].

She was among the Battle Group's forces that invaded [[Vastoros]], to free it from the control of the Witch-Empress. However the powerful Rogue Psyker's abilities allowed her to control the world's entire population and she was aided by several Chaos Warbands. When the Battle Group's invasion began, Larenta was charged with stopping the rampage of the monstrous Nightmare Engine. It was located within Vastoros' Jolvon Wilds, but the Engine was protected by the Black Legion. As her Order's Sisters and other Imperial forces charged into the Wilds' twisted forests, they dealt with ambushes and deadly traps that were placed by the Legion. However they pushed on and finally reached the Nightmare Engine. In the battle that followed, though, Larenta, [[Oswyck|Castellan Oswyck]] and [[Ghermer|Chaplain Ghermer]] were killed. Their deaths would not be in vain, as their attack finally stopped the Engine and defeated the Black Legion.
