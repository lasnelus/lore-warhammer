**Marya Somnatian** was the [[Canoness]] Superior of the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]], when [[Junith Eruita]] joined the order.

The Canoness Superior soon watched Eruita with keen interest, as she had a talent for inspirational addresses, an intensity of faith and a somewhat maniacal fondness and skill with flamer weaponry. Eruita did not disappoint Somnatian and she rose through the ranks of the Order to become a Celestian bodyguard to the Canoness Superior. They would then fight together through the killing fields of [[Ph'doro]], the purge of the [[Nightmare Hive]] and even to the gates of the [[City of the Poisoned King]]. It was during the [[Indomitus Crusade]], however, that tragedy struck at the [[Battle of Holline's Hope]] as they fought to save the world, from an invasion by the Iron Warriors. After Somnatian's forces had marched through artillery fire to reach the damaged [[Saint Holline's Basilica]], the Iron Warriors targeted the building with a devastating barrage. This caused the Basilica's roof to collapse killing hundreds of the Martyred Lady's Sisters, including Somnatian. Eruita, however, would quickly take command of the survivors and led them to victory over the Iron Warriors. This act led Eruita to be selected to succeed Somnatian, as the Order's new Canoness Superior.
