**Irinya** is a [[Canoness]] in the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]], who is taking part in the [[Indomitus Crusade]].

She was among the Crusade's forces that were defending the [[Golden Chain]] Shrine Worlds, which became all but broken by the forces of Chaos. Now only [[Velua]] remains defiant and Irinya is aiding in its defense.
