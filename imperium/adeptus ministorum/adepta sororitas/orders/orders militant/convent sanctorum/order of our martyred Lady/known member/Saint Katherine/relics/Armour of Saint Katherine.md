A suit of golden [[Power Armour]], this was originally worn by [[Saint Katherine,]] who left it in a crypt on the world of [[Sanctus Lys]] some time prior to her death.

Centuries later, it was retrieved by [[Saint Celestine]], who wore it until her death. The armour is presumed to have been destroyed in the atomic explosion that killed Celestine.
