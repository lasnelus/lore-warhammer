**Moirelle** is a [[Canoness]] Preceptor in the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]].

In M42, she was sent by her Order to end a series of insurrections on [[Varentis II]]. However the tides of the Warp were against her fleet and they arrived at the world a year later. By then Varentis' insurrections had revealed themselves to be the workings of Chaos Cults, which now had control of the world. Unbowed by this, Moirelle quickly invaded Varentis II with 4 of the Martyred Lady's Adepta Sororitas Commanderies. With the aid of her second in command [[Yves-Io|Canoness Yves-Io]], along with [[imperium/adeptus ministorum/adepta sororitas/orders/orders militant/convent sanctorum/order of our martyred Lady/known member/Theria|Palatine Theria]] and a surviving Loyalist militia, led by Bishop-Praetor [[Inigo Ravellon]], Moirelle succeeded in defeating the Heretics.
