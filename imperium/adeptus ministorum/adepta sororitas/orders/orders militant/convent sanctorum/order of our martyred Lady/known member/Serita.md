**Serita** is a [[Canoness]] of the [[Order of Our Martyred Lady]] and was stationed on the Shrine World [[Benediction]], when the Chaos invasion of the [[Talledus System]] began.

While the Word Bearers initially swept aside the Imperial forces stationed on Benediction, the survivors later rallied under Serita's command within the Grand Honorificum. There, they were able to hold out against the Word Bearers' attacks, as Imperial reinforcements arrived to save the Shrine World. However the Word Bearers sought to destroy the Honorificum and conducted a Chaos ritual that destroyed the force field protecting the building. This allowed the Word Bearers to breach the Honorificum's walls and soon Serita led the last few survivors in defending it. They would not give up though and fought with a holy fervor. Then as Serita and her forces' blood began to spill on the Honorificum, golden rays of light appeared. This heralded the arrival of golden, skull-faced spirits that swept forth from the Honorificum's ancient tombs and reliquaries. Rising high into the heavens, the spirits raised an impenetrable holy shield around the Honorificum, which forced the Word Bearers to retreat.
