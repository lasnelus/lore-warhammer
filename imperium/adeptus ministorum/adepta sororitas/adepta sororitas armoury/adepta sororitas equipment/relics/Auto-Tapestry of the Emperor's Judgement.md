The **Auto-Tapestry of the Emperor's Judgement** is a relic banner of the Adepta Sororitas' Order Pronatus and it thrums with the holy power of the Emperor's gaze.

## History

The resplendently detailed banner was weaved across the lifespans of five Canonesses and is topped with an ornate crown of iron and the skull of one of the Emperor's devout. It is currently being protected by the Reliquant at Arms Aestred Thurga, who has since carried it into the some of the Adepta Sororitas' bloodiest battles. During these battles, the glory of the Auto-Tapestry has been a boon to the Sisters who have fought under the banner's glory.
