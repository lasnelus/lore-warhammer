The Mantle of Ophelia is an Ecclesiarchy relic.

This was once a badge of office for the Prioress of the Convent Sanctorum, and was worn by the [[Living Saint Helena the Virtuous]]. The mantle is thought to have sacred powers of protection, for Helena was said to have anointed it with the Emperor's Tears.
