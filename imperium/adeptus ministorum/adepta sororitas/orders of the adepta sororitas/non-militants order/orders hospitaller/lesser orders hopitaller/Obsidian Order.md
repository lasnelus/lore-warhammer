The **Obsidian Order** is an **Order** of the [[Orders Hospitaller]].

It maintains a mission hospice on [[Alecto]], where its sisters deal with a range of maladies, from **ocean ague**, **salt-lung**, **rad-throat**, **Uhlren's echo** and **eyeburn** amongst many others. The hospice is equipped to deal with the sheer number of diseases and patients they receive.

The sisters typically wear black habits with a mesh veil hung with tiny shards of obsidian, giving them the appearance of crying gleaming black tears and are required to keep their hair short.
