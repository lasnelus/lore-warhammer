### Biography
---
Agentha was born an orphan on the planet [[Honoria]] during an Ork invasion, the daughter of [[Ladbon Antilov|Captain Ladbon Antilov]] of the Vostroyan Firstborn and [[Marita]], daughter of Honoria's Planetary Governor. Both [[Ladbon Antilov|Ladbon]] and [[Marita]] were killed by the Orks during the invasion, but Agentha was delivered just after her mother's death by [[Apothecary Rephial]], a Space Marine of the Dark Angels Chapter. The Vostroyan guardsmen Marita was with when she died honoured her wish to name the child after [[Marita]]'s mother, Agentha.

Agentha had the unusual honour of having two Space Marines present at her birth, a result of the second Marine, [[Librarian Ezekiel]] foreseeing Marita's death with his newly-returned divination abilities and attempting to save the Imperial Guard unit she was with. [[Librarian Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] also foresaw many details of Agentha's life.

Agentha was raised at a Schola Progenium facility, always at the top of her class. After her time at the schola, she was accepted into a convent of the Adepta Sororitas.
