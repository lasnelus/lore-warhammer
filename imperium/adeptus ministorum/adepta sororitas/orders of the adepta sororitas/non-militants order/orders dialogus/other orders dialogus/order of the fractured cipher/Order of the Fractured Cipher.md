The **Order of the Fractured Cipher** is an Order Dialogous.

## Overview

One of its main duties is to claim any discovered archaic Imperium documents which venerate the Traitor Legions or their Primarchs. Once in their possession, the Sisters of the Order translate and transcribe the texts and then give the records to their masters in the Ecclesiarchy, who determine what is to be done with the documents.

The Sisters of the Order of the Fractured Cipher can be recognized by their orange robes; the Order is also known to make their Sisters study languages for ten hours each day and for their refusal of any kind of Bionics or body modifications, an unusual fact for a Dialogus order. The reason for this is that the Order believes its Sisters are created in the Emperor's own image and that any type of body modification, no matter how big or small, would change His divine creation. Some of the senior Sisters of the Order are known to even frown upon the use of eyeglasses.
