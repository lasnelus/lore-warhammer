The **Order of the Illuminated Page** is an Order of the Order Dialogous.

During the Balm of Cethys Hive, a Dialogous of the Order recited the Psalms of Radiant Truth for three days without pause. She did so, as the mission she accompanied systematically torched the wretched hovels of hundreds of mutatedsump dwellers.
