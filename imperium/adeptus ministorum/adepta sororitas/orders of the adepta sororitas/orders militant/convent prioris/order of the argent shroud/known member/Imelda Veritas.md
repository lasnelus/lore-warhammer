**Imelda Veritas** was a [[Canoness]] of the [[Order of the Argent Shroud]] in the [[Gathalamor Preceptory]].

As the [[Battle of Gathalamor]] began, multiple **Preceptories** of the [[Order of the Argent Shroud]] were among the initial Imperial forces sent to aid the Shrine World. **Canoness Veritas** would take command of their Battle Sisters, with [[imperium/adeptus ministorum/adepta sororitas/troops/canoness/known canonesses/Gracia Emmanuelle|Palatine Gracia Emmanuelle]] serving as her second-in-command. Though heavily outnumbered, these initial forces needed only to prevent the Chaos invaders from claiming [[Gathalamor]], until [[Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus]] arrived. During the final battle for the Chaos bone cannon on [[Gathalamor]], Veritas fought alongside [[Achallor|Shield-Captain Achallor]] and his **Custodes** against the Word Bearers of [[Kar-Gatharr]]. Though [[Achallor]] was slain by the monstrous [[Kar-Gatharr]], **Veritas** and her Sisters were able to use the power of faith to defeat the Dark Apostle.

After the [[Battle of Gathalamor]], the [[Gathalamor Preceptory]] was seconded to the [[Indomitus Crusade Fleet Primus|Fleet Primus]], leading to **Imelda Veritas**' death during the later stages of the Indomitus Crusade. She was succeeded by [[Gracia Emmanuelle]], who took her office as Canoness in the [[Gathalamor Preceptory]].
