**Saint Silvana** was the leader of the [[Order of the Argent Shroud]].

She was one of the first Sisters and during the **Age of Apostasy** she traveled to the **Golden Throne** alongside [[Saint Alicia Dominica]]. In the years after the Apostasy she was among the first Sisters to lead crusades in the name of the **Emperor**. Shortly after Dominica founded the **Order of the Ebon Chalice**, the remaining Sisters of the **Convent Prioris** were placed under Silvana's command. However she was struck down before she could ever lead a **War of Faith**. The circumstances of her death remain mysterious. Most reliable records say she was poisoned by a **Death Cult Assassin** and suggest that the murderer was an agent still loyal to **Goge Vandire**. However other accounts state that the **Alpha Legion** may have played a part. The Sisters of the Order of the Argent Shroud maintain that the assassin had attempted to kill Dominica, but Silvana sacrificed herself. Silvana was an equally mysterious character in life. While her deeds are well known, not a single word of transcript of her speech has survived to this day.

The journal of **Ecclesiarch Alexis XXII** states that her body was laid to rest within the inner sanctum of Convent Prioris, but mysteriously vanished after seven days. Only a silver image of her bones was left, imprinted on her death shroud. This shroud became a relic for which her Order is named.
