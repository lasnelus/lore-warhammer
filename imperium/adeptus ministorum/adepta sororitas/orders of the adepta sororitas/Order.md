**Orders** are the standard organisational unit of the [[Adepta Sororitas]]. Typically, orders consist of thousands of Sisters.

### History
---
In the beginning, there were only four **Orders Militant** created by [[saint |Sister Alicia Dominica]] and her three fellow Crusading Sisters: [[Saint Katherine|Sister Silvana]], [[Saint Lucia|Sister Lucia]], and [[Saint Katherine|Sister Katherine]].

Then mid **38th** Millennium, two Orders were added by [[Deacis VI|Ecclesiarch Deacis VI]]. The Order of the Bloody Rose was created to honour [[Saint Mina|Sister Mina]] and the Order of the Sacred Rose was created to honour [[Saint Arabella|Sister Arabella]]. Although neither [[Saint Mina|Sister Mina]] or [[Saint Arabella|Sister Arabella]] led their fellow Sisters into battle, they were martyred just the same and honoured as such.

Later, Orders were created to deal with non-combatant roles. They were the Orders Hospitaller (dealing with medical aid and purification of the body), Orders Famulous (dealing with law, diplomacy and relations between the Ecclesiarchy and the Imperium), and Orders Dialogous (dealing with research, preaching, and communication). Blind also makes references to Orders Pronatus (dealing with the recovery of holy relics).
